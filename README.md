# Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) Experiment Simulation

This code simulates the Hanbury Brown and Twiss experiment using Qiskit. It calculates the second-order correlation function gÂ²(0) to demonstrate photon antibunching, bunching, and Poissonian statistics, bridging quantum optics concepts with quantum computing in a simple and unified framework.

Using quantum circuits and a custom beam splitter unitary gate, this code models and compares the photon statistics of three distinct light sources:

- **Single Photon Source** (exhibiting antibunching behavior) (sub-Poissonian statistics)
- **Thermal Photon Source** (exhibiting photon bunching) (super-Poissonian statistics)
- **Coherent Photon Source** (typical laser light statistics) (Poissonian statistics)

## Speciality of This Code

- Implements a **beam splitter as a unitary quantum gate** acting on two photon modes, bridging quantum optics concepts and quantum computing.
- Simulates different photon sources with physically motivated models within a unified quantum circuit framework.
